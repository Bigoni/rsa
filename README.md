TODO: Add steps for how to use this project, setup, etc.

For the robin_stocks dependency you need 3.0.0 (or greater)

Feature Ideas:
    
    Implement more brokers:
    Fidelity
    Vanguard
    Chase
    WellsFargo

    Maybe:
    Public (only ever used the mobile app)
    Webull (only used mobile app and annoying buy 100 requirement)
    Citi
    T.Rowe (2fa is annoying)
    others with mobile app only  

    
    Limit orders (especially useful for sell)
    Better sell logic
    Discord bot integration
    Accounting for p/l (put buy/sell prices into a db or file)
