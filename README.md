TODO: Add steps for how to use this project, setup, etc.


For the robin_stocks dependency you need 3.0.0 (or greater) which currently isn't on pypi, just download and install it from github or something
    (actually you need 3.0.1 I think, there is an issue with the order functionality, gonna try to figure this out)


Feature Ideas:
->implement more brokers:
    Fidelity
    vanguard
    Chase
    Merill
    stocktwits
    WellsFargo
    Autoshares (have to finish opening account, they have an API tho)

    Maybe brokers:
    Public (only ever used the mobile app)
    Webull (only used mobile app and annoying buy 100 requirement)
    Citi (account must be open for 90 days)
    T.Rowe (2fa is annoying)
    others with mobile app only  
->limit orders (especially useful for sell)
->better sell logic
->discord bot integration
->accounting for p/l (put buy/sell prices into a db or file)
->lots more
