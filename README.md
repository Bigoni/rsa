TODO: Add steps for how to use this project, setup, etc.


For the robin_stocks dependency you need 3.0.0 (or greater) which currently isn't on pypi, just download and install it from github or something
    (actually you need 3.0.1 I think, there is an issue with the order functionality, gonna try to figure this out)
